`STATUS: PRIMORDIAL TAR, ready soon...`

`relic` is a Clojure/Script in-memory database and data processing library, inspired by Codd's relational algebra.

It differs from other solutions in this space with its incremental materialized views, change tracking, constraints and SQL-like query DSL.

```clojure 
(rel/q db [[:from :Library]
           [:where [contains? :lib/tags "relational"] [str/starts-with? :lib/name "rel"]]
           [:join :Author {:lib/author :author/id}]
           [:select
             :lib/name
             :author/github
             [:url [str "https://github.com/" :author/github "/" :lib/name]]]])
;; =>
({:lib/name "relic", :author/github "wotbrew", :url "https://github.com/wotbrew/relic"})
```

## Pitch 

Do you suffer from _map fatigue_? [[1]](http://timothypratley.blogspot.com/2019/01/meander-answer-to-map-fatigue.html)

![despair](doc/tar2.png)

Did you try [meander](https://github.com/noprompt/meander), [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic), [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) and every graph-map-database under the sun but still do not feel [out of the tar pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf)?

Are you tired of writing mechanical wiring and glue? That has *nothing* to do with your actual business logic?

`relic` might help, but it's not a medical professional. It's a functional relational programming library.

- like SQL for clojure data.
- join with joy with the glorious relational open access information model.
- laugh at cache invalidation problems with __incremental materialized views__ and dataflow sorcery.
- relational expressions as __data__, open to introspection and analysis. Gives static tools a fighting chance.
- __constraints__ a-la-carte, gain confidence. I'm not talking just types, say things like [order can have at most 10 items if its associated customer is called bob and its tuesday](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/constraints).

Definitely not at all like the other in-memory databases in clojure. this time its different, really.

## Brief tour

I like to use `rel` as an alias.

```clojure
(require '[com.wotbrew.relic :as rel])
```

This is a query, lets find some bob's.

```clojure 
 [[:from :Customer]
  [:where [= :name "bob"]]]
 ```

You can refine queries by just adding elements to the vector.  All your favorites are here, filtering (`:where`), computing columns (`:extend`), joins (`:join` & `:left-join`), grouping and aggregation (`:agg`) and more.

```clojure 
[[:from :Customer]
 [:where [= :name "bob"]]
 [:extend [:greeting [str "Hello, " :name "!"]]]
```

Because queries are just vectors, they just sort of lounge around being values. To put them to work we have to feed some data into relic.

`relic` databases are boring clojure maps. Prepare yourself:

```clojure 
(def db {})
```

See, boring.

You manipulate your database with the [`transact`](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/transact) function. This returns a new database with the transaction applied. Plain old functional programming, no surprises.
```clojure 
(def db (rel/transact {} [:insert :Customer {:name "bob"} {:name "alice"}])

db 
;; =>
{:Customer #{{:name "bob"}, {:name "alice"}}}

```

Now we have some state, we can ask questions of relic, as you would a SQL database.

```clojure 
(rel/q db [[:from :Customer] [:where [= :name "bob"]]]) 
;; => 
#{{:name "bob"}}

(rel/q db [[:from :Customer] [:where [= :name "alice"]]])
;; => 
#{{:name "alice"}}
```

Ok ok, neat but not _cool_.

Ahhhh... but you don't understand, `relic` doesn't just evaluate queries like some kind of cave man technology - it is powered by a __data flow graph__.
`relic` knows when your data changes, and it knows how to modify dependent relations in a smart way.

You can materialize any query such that it will be maintained for you as you modify the database. In other words `relic` has __incremental materialized views__.

```clojure 
(rel/materialize db [[:from :Customer] [:where [= :name "bob"]]])
;; => returns the database, its value will be the same (hint: metadata).
{:Customer #{{:name "bob"}, {:name "alice"}}}
```

`materialize` will return a new _database_, against which materialized queries will be instant, and __as you change data in tables, those changes will flow to materialized queries automatically.__

You can do more than query and materialize with relic, you can [react to changes](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/change-tracking), use [constraints](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic/constraints) and [more](https://wotbrew.github.io/relic).

If you read the tarpit paper, you might find this [real estate example](https://github.com/wotbrew/relic/blob/master/dev/examples/real_estate.clj) informative.
